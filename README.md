# Budget Track3r

# Purpose
## This progressive web application allows an avid traveller to track their expenses to ensure their account is balanced and they can fully enjoy their travels. The traveler can track their expenses even when they're so deep in the jungle, they don't have service or wi-fi. This PWA allows for offline capabilities, and the traveler will be notified when the expenses are successfully added when service or wi-fi is found.
